1) Added Twitter Tweet looking button. 
   But actually made a div and linked the 
   text inside, and gave a design of button.
2) We have not covered iframe, but decided to 
   have unusual tweet. Used youtube embeded code 
   for the iframe.
3) When you hover over Tweet "button", the background color changes. To make the tweet button look like a button, I gave border-radius property 25px, floated it right, made the display inline-block and gave the height auto property.
4) Added follow button to each twitter post. Had a general class property, where the certain properties were in common and then gave extra class property to align each of the follow buttons individually.
5) Added search twitter input bar, which is an input element. Positioned it to the right of Twitter bird icon.
6) Created Follow Suggestions div, gave the display property inline-block, and floated it to the right.  When you hover over the suggested name, the color of the font changes and 
    when hover over the follow button, the background color changes. Once you hover over the div element of suggested people, the background color changes to beige.
